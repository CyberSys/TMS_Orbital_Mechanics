# TMS_Orbital_Mechanics - KSP Stargate
(Funky name pending)

Initial ReadMe for my KSP Stargate Mod.
Under Construction.......Partial Credits only at the moment, still working out what's getting used.

Special Thanks to 'Crzyrndm', 'Starwaster', 'wasml' and 'artwhaley' for their help so far :)

Current Concept.
----------------
- To populate the system with Stargates.
- Gates to begin 'inactive' needing the playing to find the gates on other bodies and manually activate them.
- Gate only to be activated when EVA Kerbal or Rover bound Kerbal is current active 'vessel' and only when in a certain range of the    gate
- Gates to be large enough to transport 3.75m parts (Needs to be tested in terms of scale relationship between Gate and Kerbal in       relation to TV scale.

Current To Do List :
--------------------
- Stargates :
  - Build model (Modelling Complete, texturing half way complete on SG1 gate)
  - Create Stargate 'Part'
  - Create 'Dial' Animations
  - Create 'Kawoosh' Effect (Probably particle emitter(s))
  - Get Stargates to spawn on New Game start at specified Locations (One per 'Body')
  - Get one Gate to spawn anywhere.
  - Get one Gate to spawn at specific location on Kerbin.
  - Get one Gate to spawn at specific location on another body (Probably Duna).
  - Create 'Stargate Terminal' at KSC (Possibly)

- Gate Travel :
  - Apply 'JumpDrive' Beacon system to Gates (90% Done, small details to be edited).
  - Apply 'JumpDrive' Jump system to Currently Active Kerbal or Kerbal Piloted Rover.
  - Moving Kerbal from one gate to another
  - Explore possibility of 'Gate Travel' interlude

Required Parts :
----------------
- Stargate (Possibly all four design variations: SG1, Atlantis, Universe, Tolan.  Chosen from a pop up window at first run).
- Gate Detection Sensor (To be attached to orbital probe to find gate location on surface of a body), will use Module 'Naquadah         Detector' for possible upgrade later to Naquadah Resource Mining.

Require Modules :
-----------------
- Stargate Beacon module
- Stargate Travel Module (Attached to Kerbal or Kerbal Piloted Rover)
  ((Both Derived from JumpDrive Beacon system by parameciumkid
  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60770-10x-part-plugin-parameciumkids-jump-drive-06-compatibility-update/
- Stargate Detector Module

Possible Expansions to Mod
--------------------------
- Expansion of the Gate system to support 'Galaxy' style mods. (Extra planets etc)
- Adding Naquadah as a mineable resource, making use of the already existant 'Naquadah Detector' contained withing the Gate Detection   Sensor
